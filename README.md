These are the necessary steps when making new components:
1. Figure out groupings
2. Name classes and fill divs with text
3. Switch the colors temporarily to give distinct contrast for easier styling
4. Apply spacing styles in the order of outer to the inner (e.g., child divs will be styled after their parent ones)
5. Switch off ugly temporary colors, use real colors, and style the rest.

            <h2>Subhan Poudel's Book Report</h2>
            <p>
                <strong>Unwind</strong> is a 2007 dystopian novel by young adult literature author <em>Neal Shusterman</em>. 
                It takes place in the United States in the near future.
                After the Second Civil War was fought over abortion, a compromise was reached, allowing parents to sign an order 
                for their children between the ages of 13 and 18 to be "unwound" â€” taken to "harvest camps" and 
                <strong><em>dissected</em></strong> into their body parts for later use. The <strong><em>reasoning</em></strong> is that, 
                since 99.44% of the body is used, unwinds do not <em>technically</em> die because their individual body parts 
                <em>live on</em>.
